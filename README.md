Chronic Kidney Disease

Chronic Kidney Disease Predictor is a machine learning which can help you to diagnose your kidney condition based on the laboratory test result. But I do not recommend it as your self-diagnosis tool. If you think that you have kidney disease, it would be better to go to the hospital, check your medical condition, and get the right treatment by a licensed doctor and medical staff.
